## About
On priceline branch, treat .emacs as a rough starting point/init file.
Most packages were installed with elpa and melpa was only added later.

To install packages via melpa
- manually eval L24-27
- M-x package-refresh-contents


*package-selected-packages will be a source of truth for what actually got installed versus what was specified in the init file and checked in.
