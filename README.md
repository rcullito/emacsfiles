## About
On priceline branch, treat .emacs as a rough starting point/init file.
Most packages were installed with elpa and melpa was only added for getting helm, projectile, and deadgrep to work properly

*package-selected-packages will be a source of truth for what actually got installed versus what was specified in the init file and checked in.
